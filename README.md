This project showcases an in-depth analysis of a comprehensive election dataset with 2,263 rows and 19 columns. 
The analysis commenced with meticulous data cleaning, where outliers in four features were detected and removed using the quantile method, refining the dataset to 1,941 records. 
I tackled missing values by replacing them with the mean for continuous variables and the mode for categorical ones. 
The next phase involved insightful data visualization to uncover key patterns and trends. For feature transformation,
I utilized Ordinal Encoding for categorical features and One-Hot Encoding for numerical data, followed by feature scaling using Standard Scaler to standardize the data.
A Decision Tree Classifier was employed for feature selection, and a Random Forest Classifier was trained, a
chieving an impressive training accuracy of 100% and a robust testing accuracy of around 96%. This project demonstrates a thorough approach to data preprocessing,
feature engineering, and model building, highlighting the effectiveness of advanced techniques in election data analysis.
